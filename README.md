<h2>How to access the VM through a GUI using Chrome Remote Desktop:</h2>
- go to this page: https://remotedesktop.google.com/headless.<br>
- keep pressing the blue button until you get to the "authorize button". Click <br>
the button and on the next page, copy the text below "debian linux".<br>
- ssh into the VM through GCP and once you have access into the terminal, paste and enter the text (NOTE: the text does have a time limit)<br>
- input a passkey which you'll use to access the GUI.<br>
- you can now access the GUI with your created passkey through this page: https://remotedesktop.google.com/<br>

<h2>How to access PostGresql:</h2>
- enter: su â€“ postgres <br>
- password is: 12345 <br>
- to access the postgres shell, enter: psql <br>
- to access the investment-sim database, enter: psql investment-sim <br>
- if you want to exit the current db, enter: \q <br>
- to list all tables, enter: \dt <br>
<br>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
- installed a PostGresql GUI using pgadmin4; can find it inside the top-left activities button of the desktop (search pgadmin)
- this is connected to the local PostGresql DB, which should make it easier for future development
